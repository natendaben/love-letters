		<h2>GitHub</h2>
		<p>Where do I start? I’d heard so many things about you, but never got to know you until this year. You made it so easy to get together. I created a cute <span class="special">username</span> for you to recognize me by, and we came up with a <span class="special">password</span> together to make sure everything we do is secure and private.</p>
		<p>That being said, you’re not afraid to make our relationship <span class="special">public</span>. I love how other people can view the things we make together, and even contribute to our creations! All I have to do is create a <span class="special">repository</span> — a collection of all the files we are working on together. I can even <span class="special">import</span> an old repository if we don’t want to start from scratch!</p>
		<p>You store the history of our relationship so well that I am never nervous about other people messing it up. Besides, if anyone wants to take our relationship in another direction, they can just <span class="special">fork</span> you and make a new repository for themselves. If anyone ever gets jealous and wants to copy our history exactly, they can just <span class="special">clone</span> our work and get an exact replica of our files and past commitments, without it affecting anything between you and me.</p>
		<p>Even though it was a little awkward at first that you work with <span class="special">git</span>, who I’ve had a history with, I have to admit that you make it easy to switch between both of you as I please. I can <span class="special">push</span> all of my love and hard work over to you from git, or <span class="special">pull</span> it back again to work on it by myself. You always hold my <span class="special">remote</span> work for me, so that I can come back to you and we can get right back to it. And once I’ve established trust with you, you never need me to prove myself again by logging back in. I can just push and pull whenever I need to. That’s how strong our bond is!</p>
		<p>Last, you’re amazing at communication because you’re always have <span class="special">READMEs</span> for me to look over if I get confused. People can <span class="special">markdown</span> whatever they want to tell me about their projects, and I can do the same for them.</p>
		<p>I love you so much GitHub! I can’t wait for all of the projects we will build together in the future.</p>
		<p>Love,</p>
		<p>Nate</p>
