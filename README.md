# love-letters

Welcome to Love Letters! This website is dedicated to expressing my undying love to git and github, and breaking up with bash (jk bash, I still love you but I had to add some drama!). Created for a class at the University of Colorado Boulder called Creative Web Development Tools, this project is intended to give some basic standard operating procedures on web development workflow tools. I created this website from scratch using HTML and CSS exclusively, with original artwork made in Adobe Illustrator.
