		<h2>Bash,</h2>
		<p>I hate you. You make me do EVERYTHING. It’s nice that you do things when I ask, but I don’t understand why I have to explicitly tell you every single time! Just to find out where we’re at, I have to <span class="special">pwd</span>. And even then, you’re so closed-off and guarded — I mean, I have to <span class="special">ls</span> just to find out what’s in you! Playing your favorite music from a <span class="special">cd</span> is the only way to really open you up and get deeper into your <span class="special">directories</span>.</p>
		<p>It started out okay. You would <span class="special">echo</span> things that I wanted to hear, and even make <span class="special">banners</span> for me that proclaimed our love. All it would take is a <span class="special">mkdir</span> for us to create a new folder together, and a soft <span class="special">touch</span> to fill it with new files. Whenever we were apart, I could still write to you with the help of <span class="special">nano</span>. You would even guess what I was trying to say whenever I pressed <span class="special">tab</span>, which always made me laugh.</p>
		<p>I remember all the times when we wanted to save a record of our love permanently online. It was so simple back then; we just had to log onto the server together and <span class="special">scp</span> to securely copy our files onto the internet forever.</p>
		<p>But then… something changed. When I first saw the warning signs, I tried everything. I thought that getting a <span class="special">cat</span> would help us stay together, but it just made you obsessively read your files, one after the other.</p>
		<p>Why do you hide all of your secrets from me? If I want any help, I have to go to another <span class="special">man</span>. Whenever I <span class="special">command + n</span> to turn you back on, it’s like we have to start over entirely. I don’t understand why we can’t just pick up where we left off! In fact, I don’t even feel like you’re a real person sometimes. You’re just a <span class="special">shell</span>.</p>
		<p>Now, I’m sorry to say that I’m moving all of my files out tomorrow with <span class="special">mv</span>. Once I’m done doing that, I’m going to make sure that I’ve cleared my files from your memory entirely. Yup, that’s right. I’m going to <span class="special">rm -R</span> everything that we did together, and it’s going to be permanently deleted.</p>
		<p>I wish I could just <span class="special">control + a</span> back to the beginning, or <span class="special">cmd + k</span> to clear our history, but I just don’t even know what to do with you anymore. I thought our relationship was true and everlasting, but turns out it’s actually just <span class="special">terminal</span>. I’m sorry bash, but this is the end for us.</p>
		<p>Goodbye forever,</p>
		<p>Nate</p>
