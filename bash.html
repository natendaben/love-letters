		<h2>Bash,</h2>
		<p>I hate you. You make me do EVERYTHING. It’s nice that you do things when I ask, but I don’t understand why I have to explicitly tell you every single time! Just to find out where we’re at, I have to pwd. And even then, you’re so closed-off and guarded — I mean, I have to ls just to find out what’s in you! Playing your favorite music from a cd is the only way to really open you up and get deeper into your directories.</p>
		<p>It started out okay. You would echo things that I wanted to hear, and even make banners for me that proclaimed our love. All it would take is a mkdir for us to create a new folder together, and a soft touch to fill it with new files. Whenever we were apart, I could still write to you with the help of nano. You would even guess what I was trying to say whenever I pressed tab, which always made me laugh.</p>
		<p>I remember all the times when we wanted to save a record of our love permanently online. It was so simple back then; we just had to log onto the server together and scp to securely copy our files onto the internet forever.</p>
		<p>But then… something changed. When I first saw the warning signs, I tried everything. I thought that getting a cat would help us stay together, but it just made you obsessively read your files, one after the other.</p>
		<p>Why do you hide all of your secrets from me? If I want any help, I have to go to another man. Whenever I command + n to turn you back on, it’s like we have to start over entirely. I don’t understand why we can’t just pick up where we left off! In fact, I don’t even feel like you’re a real person sometimes. You’re just a shell.</p>
		<p>Now, I’m sorry to say that I’m moving all of my files out tomorrow with mv. Once I’m done doing that, I’m going to make sure that I’ve cleared my files from your memory entirely. Yup, that’s right. I’m going to rm -R everything that we did together, and it’s going to be permanently deleted.</p>
		<p>I wish I could just control + a back to the beginning, or cmd + k to clear our history, but I just don’t even know what to do with you anymore. I thought our relationship was true and everlasting, but turns out it’s actually just terminal. I’m sorry bash, but this is the end for us.</p>
		<p>Goodbye forever,</p>
		<p>Nate</p>
