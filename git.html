		<h2>Git,</h2>
		<p>I know we’ve only been serious for a few weeks now, but it’s never too soon to express my love. I know you always have my back, and for that I can never thank you enough! You keep track of all my changes, and you know my entire history.</p>
		<p>To get you going, all I have to do is a simple <span class="special">git init</span>. And you make it so easy to see where we’re at in our relationship! I can git our <span class="special">status</span> whenever I want, to see if you are ready to <span class="special">commit</span> to what we’ve done together. Once I <span class="special">add .</span> my files, I know you’ll constantly <span class="special">track</span> what I do. My friends say it is creepy and clingy, but I know it just proves how dedicated you are to monitoring my changes. Besides, if I ever think it’s too much, I can just put certain things in your <span class="special">.gitignore</span> file, and I know you’ll leave them alone.</p>
		<p>I love how we can so easily <span class="special">commit</span> what we’ve made to history, and if I ever want to leave you a message, I can do that too with <span class="special">-m</span>! What’s more, I know you don’t mind me <span class="special">branching</span> out a little bit if I ever want to experiment or take things in a new direction. You know that if you ever get jealous of all my <span class="special">alternative branches</span>, I can just <span class="special">merge</span> everything to make things simpler between us.</p>
		<p>If I ever make a mistake, I know you’ll help me get back to the way things were, no questions asked. All I have to do is <span class="special">checkout</span> to a time when everything was perfect. If I want to, you can help me reflect on how I’ve changed over time with <span class="special">diff</span>. I can truly trust you, Git, more than I have ever trusted past flames like Microsoft Word or Wordpress, which say they are saving my work but have made false promises to me in the past.</p>
		<p>One of your best qualities, though, is that I can always look back at our full history together by pulling up our <span class="special">log</span>. It’s so much better than Facebook memories, because <span class="special">--oneline</span> makes things short and sweet, and <span class="special">--since</span> or <span class="special">--until</span> lets me look at specific periods of our time together. So customizable! You only show me what I want to see. You’ve made our history amazing so far, and I know we are going to keep committing to each other for years to come.</p>
		<p>XOXO,</p>
		<p>Nate</p>
